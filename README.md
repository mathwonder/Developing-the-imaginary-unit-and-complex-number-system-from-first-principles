<h2>Developing the imaginary unit and complex number system from first principles, and extending related applications</h2>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
The complex number system is developed from first principles with the imaginary unit being completely bypassed. Vectors are widely used in physics and angle-dependent rotation factors have been introduced to rotate vectors. A fundamental equation of position vector rotation has been discovered. An orthogonal rotation factor, which turns out to be equivalent to the imaginary unit, happens to appear in the fundamental equation. Eulerâ€™s formula has been derived through a novel approach. The existence of the rotation factor set has been found and the rotation factor set serves as a new useful mathematical tool for rotating vectors in physics equations. Based on the fundamental understanding gained from the development, unified vector algebra is conceived to seamlessly integrate vectors and complex numbers under one umbrella for mixed algebra manipulation and interchange, and to significantly extend complex numbersâ€™ practical applications in physics.
